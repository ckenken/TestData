That makes it a solid alternative to Austin, says Marchant. “The city, celebrating its 300th anniversary this year, has impressive Latin American art in Blue Star Contemporary, founded during a grassroots artist meeting. Also worth checking out is Ruiz-Healy Art in Olmos Park, a gallery curated by Patricia Ruiz-Healy that explores Latin America, borderlands and Texas discourse.” The best Tex Mex is at El Milagrito—order barbacoa breakfast tacos or fideo soup. In April, Fiesta is San Antonio’s answer to Mardi Gras, and “the city goes wild with cultural events.”"}}]}
