The historic architecture is also impressive, from the Michigan Central Station to the Inn on Ferry Street (worth a stay). Shinola Detroit has done its part to bring industry to the area and has expanded its offerings beyond watches and into an ambitious, and impressive, new hotel due to open soon. The food scene is blossoming too."}},{"type":1,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city4.jpg"}},{"type":0,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city9.jpg","title":"Baltimore","description":"Despite its history as one of the country’s most important ports, Baltimore has been overlooked, notes Biggs Bradley. “But now, with the new Sagamore Pendry Baltimore hotel, a burgeoning arts scene and the planned Under Armour campus, Baltimore’s moniker of Charm City is becoming a reality.” Owned by the billionaire CEO of Under Armour and Maryland native Kevin Plank, the hotel has an acclaimed restaurant from Michelin-starred chef Andrew Carmellini. “Baltimore’s art scene is also on the rise: Local artist Amy Sherald recently unveiled Michelle Obama’s portrait for the National Portrait Gallery and now sits on the board of the Baltimore Museum of Art. This year, the museum is showcasing such pioneering exhibitions as Moon Dust, an illumination installation work by Spencer Finch, who is known for his works at New York’s High Line Park and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.”"}}]}
