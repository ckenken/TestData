The historic architecture is also impressive, from the Michigan Central Station to the Inn on Ferry Street (worth a stay). Shinola Detroit has done its part to bring industry to the area and has expanded its offerings beyond watches and into an ambitious, and impressive, new hotel due to open soon. The food scene is blossoming too."}},{"type":1,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city4.jpg"}}]}
