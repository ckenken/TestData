It’s also home to some excellent places to stay, from the storied Brown Hotel to the buzzy 21c boutique hotel that also serves as a contemporary, multi-venue art museum. “You can get to the heart of a city by looking at its drinking culture,” he continues. Kentucky is bourbon country, and “the nearby home of Bulleit Bourbon at Stitzel-Weller Distillery is a must-see.”"}},{"type":1,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city2.jpg"}}]}
