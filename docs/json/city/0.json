It’s also home to some excellent places to stay, from the storied Brown Hotel to the buzzy 21c boutique hotel that also serves as a contemporary, multi-venue art museum. “You can get to the heart of a city by looking at its drinking culture,” he continues. Kentucky is bourbon country, and “the nearby home of Bulleit Bourbon at Stitzel-Weller Distillery is a must-see.”"}},{"type":1,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city2.jpg"}},{"type":0,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city6.jpg","title":"Columbus, Indiana","description":"“The unlikely city of Columbus has become a hot spot for architecture buffs,” says Biggs Bradley. The town’s design mastership is credited to an engine industry mogul who sponsored several notable projects in the 1950s with the aim of revitalizing the city. Today Columbus is home to some 80 modernist buildings designed by some of the 20th century’s best-known architects, including I.M. Pei and Richard Meier. This year is first Exhibit Columbus show, which will celebrate modern architecture with a citywide festival and outdoor installations. “This expo is sure to put the small but mighty Midwestern city on the map. Visit now, before the crowds descend.”"}},{"type":0,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city7.jpg","title":"Richmond, Virginia","description":"According to Marchant, Virginia’s historic capital is “buzzing with young energy and signature southern charm. Its culinary offerings are cutting-edge and reason enough to visit, with new restaurants popping up all the time.” Shagbark in the Libbie Mill Midtown neighborhood is exceptional, as is Saison in Jackson Ward. For craft beers, the Veil Brewing Company in Scotts Addition is a must. “Richmond is effortlessly stylish, and for one of the most expertly curated men’s, women’s and home stores in the country, Need Supply continues to set the bar very high.” Stay at the recently remodeled Jefferson Hotel for opulence (or an exceptional martini) or The Quirk for a more boutique setting."}},{"type":1,"itemInfo":{"imageURL":"https://ckenken.github.io/TestData/images/city/city8.jpg"}}]}
